  <img class="pri" src="images/1.jpg">
  <div id="page1">
  <h4 style="font:bold; text-align:center; font-size: 18px">Hello everyone! My name is Ilona Volchunok and I have been following a raw diet for over four years. I think eating a healthy diet is not about strict
     limitations, staying unrealistically thin, or depriving yourself of the foods you love. 
Rather, it’s about feeling great, having more energy, improving your health, and boosting 
your mood. On my website, I want to share my knowledge with you!</h4>
<img  src="images/me.jpg" class="center"/>
  <p>Healthy eating doesn’t have to be overly complicated. If you feel overwhelmed by all the 
conflicting nutrition and diet advice out there, you’re not alone. It seems that for every 
expert who tells you a certain food is good for you, you’ll find another saying exactly the 
opposite. The truth is that while some specific foods or nutrients have been shown to have a 
beneficial effect on mood, it’s your overall dietary pattern that is most important. The 
cornerstone of a healthy diet should be to replace processed food with real food whenever 
possible. Eating food that is as close as possible to the way nature made it can make a huge 
difference to the way you think, look, and feel.</p>
  <p>By using these simple tips, you can cut through the confusion and learn how to create—and 
stick to—a tasty, varied, and nutritious diet that is as good for your mind as it is for your 
body.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;" >The Healthy Eating Pyramid</h3>
<img  src="images/piramid.jpg" alt="piramid" class="center"/>
<p style="text-align:center;" style="font-style:italic;"><i>The Harvard Healthy Eating Pyramid 
represents the latest nutritional science. </br>The widest part at the bottom is for things 
that are most important.</br> The foods at the narrow top are those that should be eaten 
sparingly, if at all.</i></p>

<h2 style="text-align:center;">The fundamentals of healthy eating</h2>
<p>While some extreme diets may suggest otherwise, we all need a balance of protein, fat, 
carbohydrates, fiber, vitamins, and minerals in our diets to sustain a healthy body. You don’t 
need to eliminate certain categories of food from your diet, but rather select the healthiest 
options from each category.</p>
  <p><b>Protein</b> gives you the energy to get up and go—and keep going—while also supporting 
mood and cognitive function. Too much protein can be harmful to people with kidney disease, 
but the latest research suggests that many of us need more high-quality protein, especially 
as we age. That doesn’t mean you have to eat more animal products—a variety of plant-based 
sources of protein each day can ensure your body gets all the essential protein it needs.</p>
  <p><b>Fat.</b> Not all fat is the same. While bad fats can wreck your diet and increase your 
risk of certain diseases, good fats protect your brain and heart. In fact, healthy fats—such 
as omega-3s—are vital to your physical and emotional health. Including more healthy fat in 
your diet can help improve your mood, boost your well-being, and even trim your waistline.</p>
  <p><b>Fiber.</b> Eating foods high in dietary fiber (grains, fruit, vegetables, nuts, and 
beans) can help you stay regular and lower your risk for heart disease, stroke, and diabetes. 
It can also improve your skin and even help you to lose weight.</p>
  <p><b>Calcium.</b> As well as leading to osteoporosis, not getting enough calcium in your 
diet can also contribute to anxiety, depression, and sleep difficulties. Whatever your age or 
gender, it’s vital to include calcium-rich foods in your diet, limit those that deplete 
calcium, and get enough magnesium and vitamins D and K to help calcium do its job.</p>
  <p><b>Carbohydrates</b> are one of your body’s main sources of energy. But most should come 
from complex, unrefined carbs (vegetables, whole grains, fruit) rather than sugars and 
refined carbs. Cutting back on white bread, pastries, starches, and sugar can prevent rapid 
spikes in blood sugar, fluctuations in mood and energy, and a build-up of fat, especially 
around your waistline.</p>
  <h2 style="text-align:center">Add more fruit and vegetables to your diet</h2>
  <p>Fruit and vegetables are low in calories and nutrient dense, which means they are packed 
with vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and fiber. Focus on eating the recommended daily 
amount of at least five servings of fruit and vegetables and it will naturally fill you up 
and help you cut back on unhealthy foods. A serving is half a cup of raw fruit or veg or a 
small apple or banana, for example. Most of us need to double the amount we currently eat.
  </p>

  <h3 style="text-align:center">How to make vegetables tasty</h3>
  <p><b>Add color.</b>Not only do brighter, deeper colored vegetables contain higher 
concentrations of vitamins, minerals and antioxidants, but they can vary the flavor and make 
meals more visually appealing. Add color using fresh or sundried tomatoes, glazed carrots or 
beets, roasted red cabbage wedges, yellow squash, or sweet, colorful peppers.</p>
  <p><b>Liven up salad greens.</b> Branch out beyond lettuce. Kale, arugula, spinach, mustard 
greens, broccoli, and Chinese cabbage are all packed with nutrients. To add flavor to your 
salad greens, try drizzling with olive oil, adding a spicy dressing, or sprinkling with 
almond slices, chickpeas, a little bacon, parmesan, or goat cheese.</p>
  <p><b>Satisfy your sweet tooth.</b> Naturally sweet vegetables—such as carrots, beets, sweet 
potatoes, yams, onions, bell peppers, and squash—add sweetness to your meals and reduce your 
cravings for added sugar. Add them to soups, stews, or pasta sauces for a satisfying sweet 
kick.</p>

    <h1 style="text-align:left; color: rgb(88, 33, 151);">What Is the Raw Food Diet?</h1>
<p >Raw foods are foods that have not been cooked or processed.

  While there are varying levels of raw-food diets, all of them involve eating mostly unheated, 
uncooked and unprocessed foods. In general, a raw-food diet is made up of at least 70% raw 
foods.
  
  The diet often includes fermented foods, sprouted grains, nuts and seeds, in addition to raw 
fruits and vegetables.
  
  Many raw foodists consume a vegetarian or vegan diet, eliminating animal products and eating 
mostly raw plant foods. However, a small number also consume raw dairy products, fish and 
even raw meat.
  
  Advocates claim that raw foods are more nutritious than cooked foods because enzymes, along 
with some nutrients, are destroyed in the cooking process. Some believe that cooked food is 
actually toxic.
  
  While there are some clear benefits to eating raw fruits and vegetables, there are also some 
potential problems with a raw-food diet.
  
  A strict raw-food diet is very difficult to follow, and the number of people that stick to a 
completely raw diet in the long term is very small.
  
  Furthermore, some foods contain dangerous bacteria and microorganisms that are only 
eliminated by cooking. Eating a completely raw diet that includes fish and meat comes with a 
risk of developing a food-borne illness.</p>
  <h2 style="color: rgb(88, 33, 151);">How to Follow the Raw Food Diet</h2>
<p>To follow the raw food diet, make sure at least 75% of the food you eat is raw.

Most raw food diets are made primarily of fruits, vegetables, nuts and seeds. Grains and 
legumes are often permitted as well, but usually need to be soaked or sprouted before you eat 
them.</p>

<h2 align="center">Is Raw Food Healthier Than Cooked Food?</h2>
<p>Raw food diet supporters believe that eating mostly or all raw food is ideal for human health.

  However, like many of the core beliefs behind the raw food diet, this idea is not backed by 
science.
  
  In fact, research shows that both cooked and raw foods have health benefits.
  
  One of the main reasons the raw food diet discourages cooking is because of the belief that 
cooking destroys the natural enzymes in foods. The diet’s advocates believe that these 
enzymes are vital to human health and digestion.
  
  High heat does cause most enzymes to denature — that is, to unravel or change shape. However, 
many enzymes denature in the acidic environment of the stomach anyway.
  
  In fact, the body already produces its own enzymes to facilitate chemical processes including 
digestion and energy production .
  
  Another core belief behind the raw food diet is that cooking destroys the nutrient content of 
foods.
  
  Cooking can indeed decrease certain nutrients in food, especially water-soluble ones like 
vitamin C and B vitamins.
  
  However, cooking actually increases the availability of other nutrients and antioxidants, 
such as lycopene and beta-carotene.
  
  Cooking also helps inactivate or destroy some harmful compounds in food. For example, cooking 
grains and legumes reduces lectins and phytic acid. In large quantities, these can block your 
body from absorbing minerals.
  
  Additionally, cooking also kills harmful bacteria.
  
  For these reasons, it’s important to eat a variety of both raw and cooked foods. To learn

<h1 style="color:rgb(151, 33, 92)">WHAT IS FRUITARIANISM DIET PLAN?</h1>
<h2  align="center">WHY IS IT TRENDING?</h2>
  <p>
    Fruitarianism diet plan is a subset of raw veganism where the individual eats either all or 
mostly fruits (officially, between 50 and 75% which one can calculate by weight) as well as 
nuts and seeds for extra nutrients. It has been surging in popularity across social media 
and even Michelle Khare, a badass health and fitness YouTuber with personality, did a 
Fruitarian challenge for a week back in January of 2018. What is it? Why do people do it? 
Is it even healthy? Keep reading to find out more about fruitarianism diet plan.</p>

    <p><b>What are the benefits of a fruitarianism diet plan?</b> Benefits of the fruitarian 
diet include an influx of antioxidants and vitamins which may help combat certain ailments. 
Overall, following a raw vegan lifestyle may help with heart health, weight loss, and 
bloating. Famous fruitarians include the late Steve Jobs (who noted that it inspired him), 
Ashton Kutcher (who was hospitalized), and Mahatma Gandhi (who after 5 years, fell back to 
vegetarianism).</p>
    <h2 style="color:rgb(247, 76, 76)"; align="center">10 of the Healthiest Fruits for Your 
Body</h2>
    <br>
    <img src="images/peach.png" width="100" height="100" align="left" 
hspace="20"vspace="right:5" >
    <p><b>Peaches and nectarines:</b> Packed with potassium.Everyone knows that bananas boast 
high amounts of potassium, but two small peaches or nectarines have more of the essential 
mineral than one medium banana, boosting nerve and muscle health and making them one of the 
healthiest fruits. The skins, in particular, are rich in antioxidants and insoluble fibre. 
And for those watching their weight, peaches are a healthy way to add sweetness to any 
diet. Bake, broil, or poach them to create pies, cobblers, and other desserts.</p>
  

    <br>
    <img src="images/pineapple.jpg" width="100"
    height="100" align="left" hspace="20" vspace="right:5" >

    <p><b>Pineapple: Powerful anti-inflammatory.</b>
      Grilled, frozen, dried, or fresh, this sweet and tangy tropical fruit is jam-packed with 
bromelain, an anti-inflammatory enzyme that has been shown to reduce the risk of heart 
attacks and strokes, as well as increase fertility.</p>
    <br>
	<br>
    <br>
    <img src="images/Grapes.jpg" width="100"
    height="100" align="left" hspace="20" vspace="right:5" >

    <p><b>Grapes: Heart healthy.</b>
      As one of the world’s oldest and most abundant healthiest fruits, grapes have been proven 
to ward off heart disease and high cholesterol, thanks to high levels of the antioxidants 
quercetin and resveratrol. Each little bulb is also a great source of potassium and iron, 
which prevent muscle cramps and anemia. Stick with the purple or red kind, as they 
contain the highest concentration of healthy compounds.</p>
<br>

<br>
<img src="images/kiwi.jpg" width="100"
height="100" align="left" hspace="20" vspace="right:5" >
<p><b>Kiwi: Loaded with vitamins.</b>
  Beneath its fuzzy skin is a sweet fruit loaded with vitamins C and E, both strong 
antioxidants that protect against cancer and promote eye health. Kiwis are also low in 
calories and high in fibre, making them ideal for weight loss. Because they can last up to 
four weeks when stored in the refrigerator, they are a great snack to keep all year round.</p>
  <br>

  <br>
  <img src="images/mango.jpg" width="100"
height="100" align="left" hspace="20" vspace="right:5" >
<p><b>Mangoes: Immunity boosters.</b>
  Mangoes are becoming increasingly popular among nutritionists due to their exceptionally high 
levels of beta-carotene, which the body converts into vitamin A to promote bone growth and a 
healthy immune system. Even more, these exotic treats are packed with more than 50 percent of 
your daily vitamin C—that’s more than oranges provide.</p>
<br>

<br>
<img src="images/apple.jpg" width="100"
height="100" align="left" hspace="20" vspace="right:5" >
<p><b>Apples: Brain- and heart-healthy.</b>
  One medium apple is low on calories (only 80!) but heavy on quercetin, a powerful antioxidant 
that protects brain cell degeneration, which can lead to Alzheimer’s disease. Adults who eat 
apples are less likely to develop high blood pressure, according to one study. Apples can 
also lower cholesterol and prevent colon cancer, as well as promote healthy teeth and weight 
loss. Don’t forget to eat the skin, too—it’s especially rich in disease-fighting compounds 
like flavonoids, which reduce the risk of heart disease.</p>

  <br>
<img src="images/blueberry.jpg" width="100"
height="100" align="left" hspace="20" vspace="right:5" >
<p><b>Blueberries: Anti-aging powerhouses.</b>
  Long considered one of the beloved “superfoods,” these sweet treats are tiny but mighty, 
loaded with antioxidants and vitamin C to help fight disease, as well as anthocyanin, a 
pigment shown to boost brainpower. One study found that people who ate the greatest amount of 
this fruit were less likely to develop age-related macular degeneration, the leading cause of 
blindness in older adults.</p>
<br>

<br>
<img src="images/grapefruit.jpg" width="100"
height="100" align="left" hspace="20" vspace="right:5" >
<p><b>Grapefruit: Vitamin C powerhouse.</b>
  Although oranges are a great source of vitamin C, grapefruits pack a bigger punch. Just half 
of a grapefruit contains nearly 50 percent of your daily vitamin C, as well as high levels of 
fibre, potassium, and vitamin A. Studies have suggested that grapefruit can alleviate the 
symptoms of arthritis and repair damaged or oily skin and hair. It’s little wonder that this 
delicious fruit is no longer just a breakfast staple.</p>
<br>

<br>
<img src="images/banana.jpg" width="100"
height="100" align="left" hspace="20" vspace="right:5" >
<p><b>Bananas: Healthy on-the-go snack.</b>
  A banana is the perfect on-the-go snack, already wrapped and full of potassium and fibre to 
promote long-lasting energy and keep you alert all day long. And since it contains no fat or 
salt, bananas are a much healthier snack option than a granola bar or bag of pretzels. Want 
to make your bananas last longer? Here’s a trick: Store them in the refrigerator after 
they’re ripe. Although the peel may turn brown, the fruit underneath will stay delicious for 
three to five extra days.</p>


<br>
<img src="images/pomegranite.jpg" width="100"
height="100" align="left" hspace="20" vspace="right:5" >
<p><b>Pomegranates: More antioxidants than red wine or green tea.</b>
  Pomegranate juice has two to three times the antioxidant capacity of red wine or green tea, 
and is also a great source of potassium, which sustains energy and controls high blood 
pressure. Research shows that drinking ¼ cup of pomegranate juice daily could improve 
cardiovascular health, lower cholesterol, and help with erectile dysfunction. However, talk 
to your doctor before you drink regular amounts of pomegranate juice, as it can sometimes 
negatively interact with prescription drugs. Top salads with pomegranate seeds for a 
vitamin-packed meal.</p>
  <br>
